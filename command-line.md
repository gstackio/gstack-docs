## Get help about the `gk` command

For inline help, just type `gk help`.

To get detailed help on a specific command like `gk push`, then type
`gk push --help`.

As Gstack is based on Cloud Foundry, and the `gk` command just a mere rename
of the standatd `cf` utility, you'll find any help you need in the standard
[Cloud Foundry docs](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/).

Sometimes, you may find that the translated messages are poor for your
language (like it is with French), or you may prefer reading messages in
English. In such case, just type `export LANG=en_US.UTF-8` in your shell. Then
all output messages from `gk` will be in English for this shell session.
